Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager dashboards can be accessed quickly using `kubectl port-forward` after running the quickstart via the commands below.

> Kubernetes 1.10 or later is required.

You can also learn how to [expose Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana via Ingress](https://prometheus-operator.dev/kube-prometheus/kube/exposing-prometheus-alertmanager-grafana-ingress/)

## Prometheus

```shell
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s 9090
```

Open Prometheus on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser.

Check out the [alerts](http://localhost:9090/alerts) and [rules](http://localhost:9090/rules) pages with the pre-configured rules and alerts!
This Prometheus is supposed to monitor your Kubernetes cluster and make sure to alert you if thereâ€™s a problem with it.

For your own applications we recommend running one or more other instances.
